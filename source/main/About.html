                    My project is the main assessment for my CSC-20021 module,
                    Web Technologies.
                    This project was develop by me, student number 22021699.
                    It provides basic functions like a proper working and good looking interface,
                    login systems that store the data of users, employing the use of sessions and cookies and json file
                    by incoorporating JavaScript and PHP for the server side aspects of the services it provides.
                    The main service is the online library management system. 
                    My project for CSC_20021 consists of two parts.
                    The first involved making this website to show as proof that
                    the student has gained the skills and is able to use them to produce almost quality
                    work under minimal supervision.
                    The second part is a lab report that summarises the function of the website.
                    There I describe my way of designing the website, why I chose the implementations I used,
                    the security principles I utilized and how I achieved these successfully, including places that seemed
                    difficult, and any part of the project I could not get finished -- I finished everything ;>
                    Lastly, as part of the lab report, I am to discuss the project;s advantages and limitations
                    and how the website can be extended to increase its usefulnedd and effectiveness.

                <h2>Experience and Future Plans</h2>
                <p>
                    This project has consolidated my understanding
                    of HMTL and CSS, JS, PHP, ad the way security measures are to be taken.
                    Now I understand the working of them all and how the servers on which websites are hosted actually
                    give the data they have to our computers, the clients!
                    With the knowledge gained, and with how big this project is, I am looking to expand it further, to make
                    writing CSS easier using JS, and finishing up the remaining things I need to understad for the rest of the course.
